## FarmEquip
Rent-and-Lend-Tools is a web-based platform that connects farmers who have tools or equipment that they are willing to lend, with other farmers who need to rent them. The platform is designed to simplify the process of renting and lending tools, and to help farmers save time and money.

### Features
- Personalized Dashboard: Each farmer who signs up on the platform gets their own personalized dashboard, where they can view their rental history, tools they have available for rent, and their lending history.
- Rent and Lend Tools: Farmers can easily list their tools on the platform and set their own rental rates. Other farmers can browse available tools, select the ones they need, and make a rental request. The lender can then approve or decline the request.
- Secure Payments: Payments are securely processed through the platform using a third-party payment provider, which ensures that both parties are protected.
- Ratings and Reviews: After a rental is completed, both the lender and borrower can leave ratings and reviews, which help build trust and ensure that future transactions are smooth.
- Notifications: Users receive notifications via email or SMS when they have a new rental request, a rental has been approved, or a rental is due to be returned.

### Getting Started
To get started with Rent-and-Lend-Tools, simply sign up for an account on the platform. Once you have created an account, you can start browsing available tools, or list your own tools for rent.
